Tutorials
=========

We provide a series of tutorials for conducting WatCon analysis. Tutorials are based on the example applications described in the publication `WatCon: A Python Tool for Analysis of Conserved Water Networks Across Protein Families <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.5c00447>`_ . Structures that we used in our analysis are available on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15213225), but these tutorials can also be used for a different series of structures/trajectories.
